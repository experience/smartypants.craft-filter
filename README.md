# SmartyPants Twig Filter for Craft
Adds a [SmartyPants][smartypants] Twig filter to [Craft][craft].

## Installation
@todo

## Usage
Use the SmartyPants filter in exactly the same way as any other Twig filter.

````
{{ myVariable | smartypants }}
````

Most of the time, you'll probably want to use SmartyPants in conjunction with Craft's "Markdown" filter. Here's how to do that:

````
{{ myVariable | markdown | smartypants }}
````
